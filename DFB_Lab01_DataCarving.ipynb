        "In general, the following aspects are assumed to be known and will not be covered in detail:\n",
        "- Unix paradigm of files, directories and devices\n",
        "- Basic Shell usage\n",

        "Before beginning the practical part, a brief theoretical overview is essential to understand how a recovery procedure should be performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding how a specific filesystem works helps to clarify how deletion processes work, how files are allocated logically and physically, and most importantly where to look when searching for deallocated data.\n",

        "### The Ext filesystem\n",
        "This laboratory focuses on Ext filesystems as it is widely implemented and tested under Linux environment. Its simplicity makes it the suitable starting point for a comprehensive data forensic approach.\n",

        "\n",
        "Inodes do **not** store the file name or its path — these are maintained in directory entries that map symbolic names to inode numbers. This separation is critical in forensic analysis and data carving: inodes may remain allocated even when directory structures are damaged or missing (this is the case for _orphan files_).\n",

        "- **File Deletion Behavior**:  \n",
        "  In **Ext**, when a file is deleted, its directory entry and inode may persist until overwritten, which aids data recovery. **NTFS** marks MFT entries as deleted but often retains significant metadata. **FAT** simply marks the first character of the filename as deleted and updates the FAT chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Journaling**:  \n",
        "  **Ext3/4** and **NTFS** are journaling filesystems, enhancing data integrity but sometimes complicating recovery due to overwrites. **FAT** lacks journaling, making it more vulnerable to corruption but also leaving raw data more directly accessible for carving.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **File Name and Path Storage**:  \n",
        "  Ext separates names (in directory entries) from inodes, while NTFS stores file name attributes directly within MFT records. FAT embeds the file name directly in the directory entry."
